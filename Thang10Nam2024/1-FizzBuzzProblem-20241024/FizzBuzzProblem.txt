Math : Print out the numbers from 1 to n. If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz". 
If divisible by 5, print "Buzz". If divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

Describe : Problem need you print out number from 1 to n with those conditions
- Divisible by 3, print out Fizz
- Divisible by 5, print out Buzz
- Divisible by 3 and 5, print out FizzBuzz
- If no, print out exactly that number

How to solve
- Declare an array - an array to save the last results that you will return
- Loop from 1 to n - Use a loop to iterate over DuyetQua all number from 1 to n
- Check condition:
    * Number's divisible by 3 and 5 or not, If yes, add "FizzBuzz" to array
    * If no, It can be divisible by 3, If yes, add "Fizz" 
    * If no, It can be divisible by 5, If yes, add "Buzz"
    * If not satisfy any above conditions , add that number to array
- Return an Array
