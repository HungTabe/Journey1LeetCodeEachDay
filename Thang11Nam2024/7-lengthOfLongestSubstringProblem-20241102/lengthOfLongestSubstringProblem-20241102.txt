    Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

    Require : Find out longest subString in given string that
    dont include repeat char.
    Learn : How to use string : use Algorithm Sliding window
    ThuatToanTruot combine with a data structure CauTrucDulieu
    Set 

    How to solve
    - Input  : String s.
    - Output : String and lenth of longest substring that not 
               include repeat char 

    Strategy
    1. Use 2 pointer left and right 
       left : point out head of current sub string
       right : Browse each char in string
    2. Set to keep track char that seen
       Use a set to save chars in current sub string
    3. Browse string
       If char at s[right] not have in set yet - add in and
       update maxLenght 
       If that char already have in, that mean sub string have 
       been repeat/ In this case move left pointer to next 
       position untill sub string not have any repeat char 
    4. Do until end String 

    Example
    string : s = "abcabcbb"
    * Begin : left = 0 ; right = 0 and maxLenght = 0
    Browse each char
        * right = 0: a - add to set, maxLenght = 1
        * right = 1: b - add to set, maxLength = 2
        ...
        * right = 3: a - already have in set, move left from 0
        delete a out of set , left = 1, and add new a maxLenght 
        still  3
        Repeat intill right go to end of string
